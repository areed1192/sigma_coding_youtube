## Overview

Howdy! My name is [Alex](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-reed/), and if you're like me, you enjoy the world of programming. Or maybe you were like me a few years ago and are beginning to take your first step into this exciting world. The GitHub repository you're currently contains almost all of the code you find on my YouTube channel Sigma Coding. Feel free to clone, download or branch this repository so you can leverage the code I share in my channel.

Because I cover so many different langages on my YouTube channel, I dedicate a folder to each specific lanaguge. Right now, I cover the following lanagues on my channel:

* Python
* VBA
* JavaScript
* M Langauge (Used for Power Query & Power BI)
* SQL

This list is continuously changing, and I do my best to make tutorials engaging, exciting, and most importantly, easy to follow!

## Topics

Now, I cover a lot of topics on my channel and as much I would like to list them all I don't want to overload with you a bunch of information. Here is a list of some of my more popular topics:

* **Python:**
  * **Win32COM** The Win32COM library allows us to control the VBA object model from Python.
  * **TD Ameritrade API** The TD Ameritrade API allows us to stream real-time quote data and execute trades from Python.
  * **Machine Learning** I cover different machine learning models ranging from regression to classification.

* **VBA:**

  * **Word VBA** With Word VBA, we see how to manipulate different documents and change the underlying format in them.
  * **Outlook VBA** In Outlook, we work with email objects and account information.
  * **Excel VBA** In Excel, we do an awful lot even working with non-standard libraries like ADODB.
