From here, we can filter all of their documents to the ones that meet our criteria.\n",

If you search for a company name, you can get back more than one company back.\n",

    ">- **type**: (optional) Allows filtering the type of form. For example, if set to 10-k only the 10-K filings are returned.\n",
    ">- **dateb**: (optional) Will only return the filings before a given date. The format is as follows YYYYMMDD\n",
    ">- **owner**: (required) Is set to `exclude` by default and specifies ownership. You may also set it to `include` and `only`.\n",
    ">- **start**: (optional) Is the starting index of the results. For example, if I have 100 results but want to start at 45 of 100, I would pass 45. \n",
    ">- **state**: (optional) The company's state.\n",

    ">- **output**: (optional) Defines returned data structure as either xml (`atom`) or normal html. \n",

Once we grabbed the table, we will iterate through each row in the table parsing the columns.

Keep in mind when I say filing folder what I mean is another EDGAR query but with an additional parameter called `filenum` which contains the filing number. Once, we parsed the necessary info, we store it in a dictionary and then store that dictionary in the `master_list`, this way we have a list of all the file names."

In these situations, we can leverage the XML output to find the link that takes us to the additional results. This process is easy; we merely find the `link` tag that has a `rel` attribute set to `next`. To demonstrate this, I've added a new URL that will return over 100 results."
