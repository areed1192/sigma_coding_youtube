cYwn8Pu5eRg,2/25/2019 5:23 AM,UCBsTB02yO0QGwtlfiv5m25Q,Sigma Coding,How To Create Python Formulas For Excel,"To truly integrate Excel with Python, we need to go a step further and devise a way to incorporate formulas into our spreadsheets that run using Python. This way we can leverage the power of Python with the flexibility of Excel and along with this add new capabilities to Excel that did not currently exist. In this video, we explore how to incorporate Python formulas into Excel by creating Python objects that we can run using VBA. This will allow us to call the methods that belong to these objects and pass through our arguments to them.

After we explored the TD Ameritrade API, we noticed that some limitations came with it, for example, using a paper account and trading futures. In this series, we explore a new API that gives us access to the Interactive Brokers platform. With this API, we can do most of the same things we did in the TD Ameritrade API, but we get access to a paper account, and we get some new endpoints that will help us find opportunities.

Video 1 focuses on the background of the API, understanding some of the context needed to get us ready to build the Python library, and we will walk through some of the installation steps required to get a bare-bones version up and running.

However, there are additional ways to collect data from TDAmeritrade, one of those ways is using their Streaming API. The Streaming API, while having some similar functionality to the regular API,  will allow us to connect a web socket with their server. Once connected, this web socket will stream a steady feed of data from the services we subscribe to. In this video, we focus on building the authentication mechanism, reading the documentation, and set the stage for grabbing credential information.

For example, running data pulls every Monday morning before we get into work. Well, in this video we are going to see how to run our macros on a schedule using a combination of different files and the Task Scheduler application. This way we can make a macro once share it with many and now run it at specified intervals.

While these videos went into the inner workings of the API, they also exposed some challenges. Some of those challenges included making properly formatted requests, validating the input arguments, and handling the varying complexity in the type of requests made.

All of this and more inspired me to make an API Client library that would make working with the API more comfortable, reduce some of the complexity related to making requests, and incorporate validation features to reduce errors from being made. In the first part of this series, we cover the overall context of the project, what influences impacted the way the code was written, an overview of the main functionality of the library and begin the process of handling authentication.

This process of web scraping can be a time-consuming as it requires us to know the layout of the document and isolate the items. However, Python users have access to a robust library that makes the process of web scraping easy & quick. The name of this library is BeautifulSoup and in this video we will explore how to use this library.

The Pythonnet library is a remarkable tool that will allow us to plugin to .Net CLR. With this access, we can leverage built-in class libraries written in C# and different API libraries for Windows. However, one of the most powerful features of this library is it will give us the tools necessary to create our own Python Excel Object Library. The Excel Object Library will provide us with complete control of the Excel VBA object model and the ability to customize those objects to meet our different needs.

While useful, it lacked one important feature, being able to stream data using the TD Streaming API. With the streaming API, we can connect a web socket to the TD Server and have a steady flow of data flow back to us. Additionally, we can access more endpoints some of which include Level 2 data.

In this series, we take our API Client and extend its functionality so that it can create a new streaming client object, connect a web socket to the TD Server, log a user into the streaming service, help the process of building service requests, and being able to write the data to a file or database as it streams in.

The first connection object we will be working with is an OLEDB Connection that connects to an external Excel workbook. With this connection, we can pull in data from other workbooks and perform SQL queries that limit the data we pull in.

K2-ob6FcAAc,2/11/2020 3:44 AM,UCBsTB02yO0QGwtlfiv5m25Q,Sigma Coding,Working With Excel VBA Connection Objects | Power Query Connections,"Let’s move on to a prevalent type of connection, a connection to a Power Query “Data Query”. With Power Query, we can aggregate data from different sources and mash them up into a single source. Most people aren’t aware that they can leverage these queries as workbook connections and even use them inside of their workbook using VBA. In this video, we focus on connection to queries using a connection object in the Excel VBA object model.

I am a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com. One of the ways I support the channel is by using Amazon Associates to earn fees on purchases you make. That means when you use the link above, it will track any purchases made from that link and give a small portion of it to the Sigma Coding. I love this approach because it allows you to do what you're already doing (shopping) but also helps support the channels you care about. Also, it makes it where I can invest that revenue to help improve and grow the channel.

Now that we know how to make the basic API calls we will move on to orders. Placing orders with the TD API is an in depth topic that will take a few videos to fully comprehend. In this video, we will focus on the operations we can perform on orders. The operations include, creating new orders, modifiying existing orders, and deleting exisiting orders.

Now this series will cover multiple videos just because of the sheer amount of content we have to cover. Additionally, a lot of these topics will be new to those of us who have come from a VBA background, so while it might seem overwhelming at points, it's important to remember that over time the concepts will stick. In this first video, we are going to give a high-level overview of how web add-ins differ from regular COM add-ins in the world of Microsoft Office.

A service request is just a request for certain data from a specific endpoint. Like in the standard API, it would be nice if we could incorporate validation features to ensure that the service request being built is a valid one.

Also, I don't know about you, but I hate remembering numbers and one thing about building a service request is to remember the number that maps to each field in that service request. For example, 1 could map to closing price. Let's make it more user-friendly and have the option of either passing through a field number or a field key.

With user forms, you can provide your users with an easy way to leverage your newly added functionality without having to write a single line of code. In this tutorial, we will create an Excel user form from scratch. The user form will take an Excel object we specify and export it to a different office application.

For example, our access token is only valid for 30 minutes! Do we expect a user to go through the process of getting a new access token every time it expires? I hope not!

What we can do is handle that process for them behind the scenes while the API Client runs. However, we need to add some functionality that checks whether the access token is expired, functionality that will handle the process of getting a new access token using our refresh token, saving our new state after we get a new access token, and handling errors as they arise.

Orders come in many different forms, each one designed to help handle a variety of situations. Now while, it's not possible to show you every possible order out there we can explore the main types of orders and the common structures they take on. Additionally, we will see how those common structures translate over to the TD API. Additionally, we will explore the importance of understanding how the entering or exiting the position and whether you're going long or short impacts the overall structure of the order.

To say, that I manage the channel the same way as when I first started it couldn't be further from the truth. Some things I did were correct, other things not so much. As I got more familiar with YouTube and my viewers I began to realize that if I wanted to focus more on what I like doing, creating content, I needed to automate the management of my content. That way as my channel grew and I grew, the content could grow along with it. Well, this series is dedicated to sharing that journey and how I did it. In this series, I'll show you how I manage my YouTube Channel and the other platforms that I use to share that content using Python. Additionally, for those of you with your own channel, I'll share my experiences building a YouTube channel, the mistakes I made, the things I did right, and where I would like to take it.

Well, in this video, we will cover how to export those macros to source control provider called GitHub. By storing our macros on GitHub we can save them in a cloud-based application so that way if we lose our personal Macro Workbook we don't lose our macros.

I am a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com. One of the ways I support the channel is by using Amazon Associates to earn fees on purchases you make. That means when you use the link above, it will track any purchases made from that link and give a small portion of it to the Sigma Coding. I love this approach because it allows you to do what you're already doing (shopping) but also helps support the channels you care about. Also, it makes it where I can invest that revenue to help improve and grow the channel.
